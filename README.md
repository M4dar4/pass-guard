# Pass Guard

A python and SQL based program which generates a random password for you and stores it in a database if you want.Database file is encrypted everytime program exits and decrypts when data is accessed. You need to run program with root priviledges so that a normal user cannot access your passwords.

## Usage

Clone to the repository

```bash
cd pass-guard
python3 passguard.py
```
### Update
I have made a major upgrade now you can generate password as well as pins using this program. Now you can setup password which program asks at beginning to verify your identity.
